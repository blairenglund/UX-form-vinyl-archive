__Monday__

Your project for the week is to build a complex UX form interaction. We'll go over it in class, as there are quite a few things going on in the design. Expect this to take you the better part of the week. 

Homework: *Journal entry* - Is coding fun? Why? Try to describe a time when you enjoyed coding. What else is coding (e.g. frustrating, uplifting, confusing, challenging, empowering)?
