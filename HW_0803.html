<h1>Industry Culture Workshop - Part One</h1>

<h2>1. The Set-Up-To-Fail Syndrome</h2>

<h3>In the example scenarios posited by the researchers, do you feel that either the bosses or subordinates acted out of ill-will? Who do you feel was most at fault? If it's difficult for you to choose, why?</h3>

<p>I don't think their was necessarily any conscious ill-will, but unconscious biases can rear their heads. I do believe the superior does have more responsibility to break the set-up-to-fail cycle. By virtue of being a superior, and having that added power (and pay to match), it becomes their responsibility to recognize and remedy these situations effectively. It is much harder for a subordinate to change their superior's opinions about them, but the superior can establish methods of preventing the problem. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Challenging their own assumptions about employees and their individual performance</li>
<li>Learning to recognize triggers that cause the set-up-to-fail cycle</li>
<li>Creating an environment where people are comfortable voicing their thoughts and questions</li>
<li>Being active with all employees early on and being clear about projects and goals</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How do techâ€™s biggest companies compare on diversity?</h2>

<h3>Did any of these numbers surprise you? What do you think contributes to the disparity between these demographics' overall workforce share and share of the tech workforce?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, no. I do follow these kinds of stories regularly. Gender and racial disparities in tech are still huge. And while efforts to shrink these disparities have worked, they haven't worked well for all demographics. Asian men are well-represented compared to the U.S's overall demographics, but black and latina women lag well behind their white and male counterparts. I think this has a lot to do with access. Access to education and employment has not been available and still isn't for most people. Those who don't already have the wherewithal to afford and attend school will find themselves up against countless barriers to employment. Beyond access there are still biases that people hold and many of those people are people in hiring positions. This means that it's still mostly the domain of white men. Especially when looking at the percentage of white men holding leadership positions in tech companies.</p>

<h3>Are all groups represented in management the way they are in the general tech workforce? Who is under-represented? Over-represented?</h3>

<p>No. Women and women of color especially are underrepresented. Leadership roles still tend to be mostly white and male.</p>

<h3>Think back to previous jobs you've had or jobs you've aspired to have. Did you see people you identified with as leaders in those professions? Was that important to you? Why or why not?</h3>

<p>I have. There aren't a lot but it is something nice to see.</p>
